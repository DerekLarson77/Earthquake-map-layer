Earthquake-map-layer

1)  Conducted an API call to get magnitude and depth of all earthquakes that occured in the previous 24 hours, from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.
2)  Three map layers were used with the map, and an additional overlay to display or not display pins.
3)  The location of each earthquake was pinned to a map with multiple layers.  
4)  The size of the marker was determined by the magnitude of the quake, and the color of the marker got darker the deeper the depth of the quake.
5)  Cluster groups were added to the markers, so it was easy to determine the number of quakes in a small vicinity.
